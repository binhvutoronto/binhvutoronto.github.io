                <p align="justify">My name is Binh. I am from Toronto. I am an adventure seeker, a learner of things (LoT), a lawyer and an aspring coder.</p> 
             
                <p align="justify">As a corporate lawyer, I help companies with their corporate transactions and financing activities. While working with my clients, I have traveled to many countries such as Germany, Ukraine, Bulgaria, South Africa and China, just to name a few. My clients are mainly from the mining and technology industry. With my mining clients, I am able to travel to different areas of the world where their operations are located. With clients in the technology industry, I am able to satiate my interest in the technology world. </p>
                
                <p align="justify">My interest in technology is the reason why I am learning to code. I want to get a better understanding of my clients' business. I also want to learn more about coding and technology as I believe that the practice of law will rely more and more on technology for certain aspects.</p>
               
                <p align="justify">Outside of my professional career and aspirations, I take every chance I have to travel. Learning about new cultures, trying new food and experiencing different activities are the joy of life. When I have free time and in the right place, I love playing golf, surfing, snowboarding, scuba diving and learning technical analysis in the stock markets.</p>
